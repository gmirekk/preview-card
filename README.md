## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Less preprocessor
- ZURB Foundation grid

### What I learned

Some of the major learnings in this project is using mix-blend-mode to set design-accurate image overlay. Also, first hand use of Foundation framework to lay out structure of the website.

```css
.desktop-img {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  opacity: 0.72;
  max-width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future projects I want to focus on mobile-first approach to complete a project and extend my practice with using Less preprocessor and JS to make the webiste fully functional.

### Useful resources

- (https://get.foundation/) - This helped me lay out a grid for the website. I love minimalistic classes and flexibility this framework allows developers.
